# fold_slice

This is Yi Jiang's customized code for X-ray/electron ptychography and tomography/laminography.
The package is built upon the Matlab code developed at PSI: https://www.psi.ch/en/sls/csaxs/software

To run GPU-based ptychography reconstruction, you have to use MATLAB 2018a. Other version may not work properly. This is the way!
